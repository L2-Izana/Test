                Congratulations! You have just had the first step in knowing more about computers and digital world.<br/>
                As you know, we are using decimal number system (base ten). <br/>
                Every number used in daily life are created from 10 digits: 0, 1, 2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.<br/>
                For example:
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>You get a <b>88</b> on your test.</li>
                    <li>You have $<b>21,760,427</b> in your bank account.</li>
                </ul>  
                However, computers are unable to understand those base-10 number like humans. <br/>
                Therefore, to make them understand decimal numbers like humans, scientists make use of binary system (the least complex digit system, only 0 and 1) to create an own language for computers using electric signals.<br/>
                Using the 8-bit binary number (for simplicity):
                <ul type="circle">
                    <li>The test mark <b>88</b> is understood by computer as <b>01011000</b> because <b>88 = 1*64 + 0*32 + 1*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 9*2 + 0*1</b>. </li>
                    <li>Similarly, $<b>21,760,427</b> is represented as <b>1 0100 1100 0000 1001 1010 1011</b>.</li>
                </ul> 
                So as in Mathematics, a 8-bit system can represent every integer from 0 to 255 and nowdays, the 64-bit system can represent at most an incredibly massive number.<br/>
                However, if you play gambling and loose all your $<b>21,760,427</b> in your bank account and unfortunately have $<b>100</b> in debt. So we can say that you have <b>-100</b> dollars.<br/>
                But what? Till now, we only know that computer can interpret an integer that is greater than or equal to 0.<br/>
                Luckily, scientists create new useful concepts: <b>Signed and Unsigned binary number system</b>, <b>One's complement</b>, and <b>Two's complement</b>.<br/>
                Let's step to <a href="#s2">Section 2</a> for further explanations of those concepts.

            <h3 id="s2"><b>2. How Two's complement is expressed</b></h3>

                <li>
                    <h4 id="a">Signed and Unsigned binary number system:</h4>
                    <p><i>For explanations and examples, let's use <b>8-bit number</b> for simplicity</i></p>
                    <p>As in <a href="#s1">Section 1</a>, we know that the highest positive number can be represented is <b>255</b> (<b>1111 1111</b>) and people call these 0 and positive sets of numbers only are represented as a <b>Unsigned binary number system</b></p>
                    <p> But in <b>Signed binary number system</b>, from <b>255</b> (<b>1111 1111</b>) in <b>Unsigned binary number system</b> is only equal to <b>-1</b> in this sytem. Suprised, right? Don't worry, we have just create the first ever negative number for the computer.</p>
                    <p>The rule for the <b>Signed binary number system</b> is extremely easy to comprehend, just remember:</p>
                    <p>Consider the <b>left-most bit</b> as a sign of the integer:</p>
                    <ul type="square">
                        <li><b>0</b> indicates a <b>positive</b> number.</li>
                        <li><b>1</b> indicates a <b>negative</b> number.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example: <b>1000 0001</b> indicates a negative number where as <b>0111 1110</b> indicates a postive number.</p>
                    <p>Here, we have an important assumption from this rule: Instead of a range of 0 to 255 in <b>Unsigned binary number system</b>, the <b>Signed binary number system</b> is unable to understand all integers in range -128 to 127</p>
                    <p>Let's jump in <a href="#b">Part b</a> to have more deeper understanding.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 id="b">One's complement and Two's complement:</h4>
                    <p>As in <a href="#a">Part a</a>, we know that <b>Signed binary number system</b> can help computers understand the negative decimal numbers. So now, let's grasp the most important knowledge - <b>Using the 2's complement number system to represent negative integers</b>:</p>
                    <p>Taking <b>7</b> or <b>0000 0111</b> as the example here. Let's understand the procedure of why this postive number is related to <b>1111 1001</b> or <b>-7</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Firstly, we create the <b>One's complement</b> by toggling 1 to 0 and 0 to 1. Specifically, the <b>One's complement</b> of <b>0000 0111</b> is <b>1111 1000</b>.</li>
                        <p>Similarly, the <b>One's complement</b> of <b>0101 0101</b>(<b>85</b>) is <b>1010 1010</b></p>
                        <li>Secondly, we add 1 to the <b>One's complement</b> to create the <b>Two's complement</b>. Specifically, the <b>Two's complement</b> of <b>0000 1111</b> is <b>1111 1000</b> + 1 = <b>1111 1001</b>(<b>-7</b>)</li>
                        <p>Similarly, the <b>Two's complement</b> of <b>0101 0101</b> is <b>1010 010</b> + 1 = <b>10101011</b>(<b>-85</b>).</p>
                        <li>Finally, to verify:</li>
                        <ul type="square">
                            <li><p><b>0000 0111</b> + <b>1111 1001</b> = <i>1</i> <b>0000 0000</b></p></li>
                            <li><p><b>0101 0101</b> + <b>1010 1011</b> = <i>1</i> <b>0000 0000</b></p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
